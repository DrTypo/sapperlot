### PDF Type Specimen

The enclosed type specimen shows some use cases and explains how to use Sapperlot in InDesign (*.idml* file).

### Using the Precompiled OTFs

Install the OTFs, and place four text frames with the same content exactly on top of each other. Make sure each text frame uses a different Sapperlot family member, and a different color. You can use the Place-and-Link tool in InDesign to facilitate that process. Take a look at the enclosed InDesign document.

### Using the Source File

To open and edit the source file, *Glyphs Sapperlot.glyphs*, you need the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/), version 2.0 and above. Read the [tutorial on layered colorfonts](http://glyphsapp.com/colorfonts) for more details.
